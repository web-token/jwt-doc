# Signed Tokens

To use the signed tokens \(JWS\), you have to install the [`web-token/jwt-signature` component](https://github.com/web-token/jwt-signature).

```bash
composer require web-token/jwt-signature
```

When this component is installed, signature algorithms are automatically handles by the Algorithm Manager Factory.
